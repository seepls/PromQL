### Web app with microservices
Application's health + metrics
Notice Unwanted Behaviour

IDEA : Integrate  prometheus monitoring + Web App ( JAVA SPRING BOOT )

#### Technologies used 
Spring boot

Spring boot Actuator

Micrometer : Vendor-neutral applications metrics facade, has support for prometheus (e.i transforms the metrics into data that monitoring system can understand)

Client(curl,wget,browser) : queries end point

prometheus can also come in and query the endpoint


#### STEPS 
1. create droplet

2. Install prometheus

3. install Grafana

4. Install Docker
